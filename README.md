# Offline CDN

A simple static content server to serve up libraries and CSS in a CDN fashion when I have no internet connection.

    cd app

    npm install
    
    node index


listening on port 5000 as default

example:    

js

    localhost:5000/js/semantic.js

css

    localhost:5000/css/semantic.css
